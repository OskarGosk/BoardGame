# ðŸŽ² BoardGame

The application is designed to **record and analyze board game sessions**.<br/><br/>

With this app you can:<br/>
- **Create a player list** â€“ each player has their total number of games played and wins stored.<br/>
- **Create a board game list** â€“ games can be added manually (basic data: name, number of players, type, expansion/base game) or automatically imported from the **BoardGameGeek (BGG)** database.<br/>
- **Add gameplays** â€“ each session contains information about the game played (base/expansions), participating players, the winner, the date of the session, and an optional description.<br/>
- **Browse game history** â€“ see a list of past sessions with the date, game name, participants, and the winner.<br/>
- **Analyze statistics** â€“ e.g., how many players participated in sessions, which games are played most often, how many wins each player has, and reports in chart form.<br/><br/>

The application works in two modes:<br/>
- **Guest** â€“ data is stored locally.<br/>
- **Logged-in user** â€“ data is synchronized with the **Firebase Database**, allowing saving and retrieving across devices.<br/>
